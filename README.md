Encrypting/Decrypting texts
Encrypting: Change all letters to another one, for example all the letters "a" will change for a random letter.
Decrypting: Is a manual decrypting code that uses frequency of the letters in a language, for example the most used letter in English is "E" but in the text the most used letter is "B", the code will change the B´s for E´s and do it for all the 26 letters of the alphabet. After that the text will be almost ready, the user will only need to input manually the last letters that will need to be switched.
